Born, raised and still hanging around in Cork, Ireland, I've been a lover of all things techie and
geeky since I can remember. I have a degree in Computer Science and a masters in Data Science,
several years of experience as a software developer and am always looking for new things to learn
and try out.

st.markdown(''' 
The original intent of this website was to demonstrate the results of my master's thesis:
"Machine Learning for the use of careless response detection in survey data"
but it has expanded somewhat. In particular I was jsut going to create a basic website deployed with AWS 
but the more I learned about the possibilities it offered the more I wanted to try out.
The various techs used are listed in more details in the "How this site was built section". 
It has been a load of fun and a great learning experience navigating not just the possibilites
on offer and how to adapt them to what I wanted, but also figuring out the inevitable 
problems and how to work around them.
